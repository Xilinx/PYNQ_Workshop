    "The PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 boards have two Pmod ports and an Arduino interface. The PYNQ-Z2 also has a Raspberry Pi interface. A number of Pmod, Grove, and  Peripherals are supported by PYNQ. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pmods can be plugged directly into the Pmod port. Grove Peripherals can be connected to the Pmod Port or Arduino header through adapter boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The external pins of these interfaces are connected to PL pins. This means the logic to control an external peripheral must be implemented in the PL in an Overlay. Pmods, Grove and Arduino peripherals can be used with IOPs in the *base* Overlay for the PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show how to use the [Grove Temperature Sensor v1.2](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature_Sensor_V1.2/) with the Grove I2C  ADC [Grove I2C ADC ](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_ADC/) on the PYNQ-Z1 or PYNQ-Z2 board. The Grove Temperature sensor produces an analog signal, and requires an ADC. You will also see how to plot a graph using _matplotlib_, a Python package for 2D plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Grove Temperature sensor, a Grove ADC, and a Pynq Grove Adapter Adapter are required for this notebook example (a Pynq Arduino adapter could also be used instead of the Pynq Grove Adapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The driver for the Temperature sensor running on the IOP supports reading a single value of temperature, or reading and logging of multiple values at regular intervals."
