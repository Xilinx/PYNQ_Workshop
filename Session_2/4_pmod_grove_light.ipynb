    "When the ambient light intensity increases, the resistance of the LDR or Photoresistor will decrease. This means that the output signal from this module will be HIGH in bright light, and LOW in the dark. Values for the sensor ranges from ~5.0 (bright) to >100.0 (dark). The sensor is more sensitive to darkness, and saturates in ambient light. "
