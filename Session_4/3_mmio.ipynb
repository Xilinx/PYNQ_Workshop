    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to show how to use the MMIO (Memory Mapped I/O) PYNQ class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware design\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the same bitstream from the previous example with three AXI GPIO controllers connected to the LEDs, buttons, and switches. While there are PYNQ drivers available to read and write the AXI GPIO LEDs, switches, for demonstration purposes the AXI GPIO controllers will be used to show how the PYNQ MMIO class can be used. \n",

    "![AXI GPIO Design](./images/axi_gpio_design.png \"AXI GPIO Design\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will seem very similar to the previous lab. We will be exercising the buttons, switches and LEDs in a similar way,  but you should note that we are using the MMIO class directly, and that there are small differences in code. For the MMIO class, we will be specifying an offset address that we read or write to. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you examine the driver code for the *LED*, *switches*, and *buttons* classes, you will notice that they use the PYNQ MMIO class. "

    "\n",
    "In this example, the MMIO class will be used to directly access the register space of the AXI GPIO and control the IP. \n",
    "\n",
    "An AXI GPIO controller has two channels. In the design, only 1 channel of each AXI controller is used (as described in the previous lab). We will only use two registers:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data register is mapped to offset 0x0, and the tristate register is mapped to offset 0x4. To use an AXI GPIO, the tri-state register must be set to configure the IP as input or output. The data register can be read or written to. For example, the AXI GPIO connected to the LEDs sets the tri-state register to configure the IP as an output. The LEDs will turn on or off corresponding to the value written to the data register. For the buttons, or switches, the IP is configured as *input* and the value in the data register will be the value corresponding to the position of the switches or buttons. \n",
